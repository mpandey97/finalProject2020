Follow the guide in the README.\nIf none of these fix the issue, please open an issue on the Github repository: https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-image-picker-ios`);\n}\n\n/**\n * We export the native interface in this way to give easy shared access to it between the\n * JavaScript code and the tests\n */\nexport default {\n  ...RNCImagePickerIOS,\n};\n"]}
